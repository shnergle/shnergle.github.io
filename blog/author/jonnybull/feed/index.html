The three words we’ve been impatient to say and you’ve been craving to hear. If this is the first time these 3 words have caressed your ears, then clearly you haven’t been Shnergling, so where have you been? I can only assume that you have been invited to play a lengthy game of Risk in a hermits hollow somewhere. Fear naught, before you read any further <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/shnergle/id681930464?mt=8">download Shnergle</a> and catchup!</p>
<p>So, the app was released in the UK App Store on Thursday 15 August. Having jumped through the hoops with Apple, we were elated to have it approved. <i>Right then chaps, green light, good to go!</i></p>
<p>It’s in our DNA to move fast. So the time to spring from the trap was obvious, go at once! (huh-hmm) Just one problem – <i>I</i> wasn’t going to be around for the launch date. I had a prior engagement to attend a dear friend’s wedding in Finland. What does this mean? Our CMO, the man who had been planning on how we would enter the market will not be present <i>on launch day</i>!</p>
<p>Should we delay?</p>
<p>Certainly not! We’ll adapt and overcome. I don’t believe that question ever entered anybody’s mind, especially when Rob said to me with a wry smile on handover before I left, “your laptop’s portable right?” The connotations were obvious; my wife will be thrilled! I was sad not to be present, as it’s the moment every marketer is chomping at the bit for. Such is life, dwell no further.</p>
<p>As I jetted off to sample the saunas, the team were preparing to ‘go over the top’. Roles and responsibilities were to take an abrupt change as Rob was leading the charge on a weekend Promo Team campaign. A situation alien to everyone, but just like everything experienced so far it was a case of learn fast and implement quickly. Mistakes may well happen, they are part of the learning process.</p>
<p>The whistles have blown! <i>Over we go!</i></p>
<p>The first weekend taught us much. Much about our customer, much about the app and much about ourselves. A transformation was occurring. So far the app had been built to a specification largely determined internally. Now, the app must be adapted to feedback coming externally; from the public. Adam, Stian and Harshita were quick on the uptake and were already building updates to improve the app, with version 1.2 coming only a few days after launch and 1.3 due in a few days from now. Each one making a significant improvement to performance and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>As we seek out ways to make Shnergle successful like our lives depended on it. Our mantra remains that we will only fail if we stop learning and fail to implement what we’ve learnt.</p>

Carrying their disposable mugs like a royal orb. The daily morning demand for takeaway coffee is habitual, or for some a necessity.</p>
<p>Brew drinkers visit cafés in waves throughout the day. The first wave splashes over the doorway on opening and welcomes the “breakfast boosters”. Kick starting the day with a pre-work pit stop, zombies on arrival are rocket men on departure. The “mid-morning escapers” are the next wave to surface. Typically around 1030, having fired-off a few emails and demonstrating some work progress, these will spill out from the office in search of their caffeine hit. Cafés must then prepare and rebuild their defences in time for the big invasion at noon; enter the “lunchtime raiders”. Speed is of the essence in the lunch hour, and the more time that is spent queuing and waiting takes away from the precious time remaining for enjoying a deserving break.</p>
<p>Whichever wave you surf on, timing your visit can often be crucial. Nothing can be more disappointing than arriving and seeing what you didn’t expect; the queue coming out of the door, nowhere to sit down, food choice is minimal. It’s frustrating and now it’s affecting your decision whether to stay and be patient or take your chances elsewhere. Ultimately, your time is beginning to feel wasted. Time to make a quick decision.</p>
<p>‘<em>If only you had checked on Shnergle first!</em>’</p>
<p>Having spared a moment to check out the Shnergle app on your phone before you set off could have avoided a wasted trip. Seeing what the situation was like in the café before you’d committed to go, may have convinced you to either go somewhere else, or go at a different time.</p>
<p>Alas, all is not lost!</p>
<p>Why not use the Shnergle app now? You’re stood somewhere you no longer want to be and still need to find somewhere to go. You’re back in to the decision cycle of deciding where to go. Pull your phone out your pocket and see for yourself what the venues are looking like around you. Make it your default setting, think to yourself – ‘I’m still deciding, can Shnergle help?’</p>
<p>Shnergle can help you make the best choice at the time you are making your decision.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.shnergle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WP_20130627_001.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-128" alt="tube delays" src="http://www.shnergle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WP_20130627_001-1024x576.jpg" width="504" height="284" /></a>The London commute is a trying and stressful adventure for many of us. Travelling in to London or across it, rail is frequently the only viable option, and so we’re at the mercy of it every day. The alarm clock in the morning is the ‘starting-gun’ for the race to work. The first leg of the race is to be at the opportune place on the platform ready to commandeer a seat on the arriving train. It is a mundane task, though occasionally the monotony is broken when you discreetly chuckle to yourself at the sight of the late-comers making a frenzied dash to the platform.</p>
<p>Once on-board, you make a firm stride towards your chosen seat (god forbid somebody should be already sat there). And now, the race takes an awkward pause. You sit there for the next 45 minutes or so, having your personal space being violated by the overcrowding, and the irritating sound of the music blaring from the selfish twit opposite you. It isn’t pleasant.</p>
<p>Later, out of the dull background hum, you hear the train conductor’s voice interrupt for his &#8216;underground update&#8217;. You sit upright as it indicates we’ll soon be arriving into London Waterloo and the second leg is about to start. He announces, “<i>delays only on the Waterloo &amp; City line</i>!” Whilst others around you breathe a sigh of relief, you quickly give no quarter to their concerns and think: “Damn it!” That was the line you were planning on taking to your next important appointment. Your blood pressure has risen, your heart rate increases, shoulders have become tense. You are now stressed. You cannot afford to lose time with things going wrong today.</p>
<p>Helplessness is what aggravates you the most. The predicament you cannot control.</p>
<p>Your travel strategy has just been torpedoed! So, just like in any other strategic decision, you go through a cycle of; analysing – choosing – implementing. The analysis has just been done, but only partially by the train conductor mentioning the ‘delays’. You are basing your decision on a perception of a word. You haven’t seen it for yourself and so cannot make a better judgement or indeed analysis over its severity and therefore how much it really does affect your original ‘travel strategy’. It would be helpful to have the right information now so you can make a decision before you arrive and see the delays for yourself.</p>
<p>This is exactly where Shnergle can help. Shnergle allows users to ‘recce’ (short for reconnaissance) a place before they arrive, by providing time-stamped and geo-tagged images. It helps you make the decision before you physically arrive there and see it for yourself. Although this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMwYbR1ywFM">video</a> has used the pubs &amp; clubs scene to mainly demonstrate the apps use, the concept is so easily applied to commuting as well. For instance, you may see the image that’s at the top of this blog post on the Shnergle app, and notice it was taken 5 minutes ago at the Waterloo underground for the Waterloo &amp; City line. You can make your own analysis of the image and you may choose an alternative option (by taking instead the Jubilee and the Northern line). So, when you arrive at Waterloo you are ready to implement your revised travel strategy and save yourself a heap of time by not getting caught up in the delays. Wouldn’t that regain some control when things go wrong on your commute?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-99" alt="Busy London bar" src="http://www.shnergle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WP_20130524_001-1024x576.jpg" width="493" height="277" />When the call for heading out for a sociable drink at a bar with friends beckons, nobody wants to waste time thinking about where they should go. You just want to be there; in the right place that suits you. No worries, just pleasant conversation whilst enjoying a refreshing drink. Sounds good doesn’t it. Sounds easy, and so it should be.</p>
<p>How many of us have our stomping grounds? The areas that we know really well, and if an out of town friend comes to visit that’s where you end up taking them. I think most of us are guilty of that. It’s usually an area close to work, close to home or because we now know the owners of an amazing pub somewhere so we’ll stay loyal.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that we also like to be thrilled with finding something new and unique. Like the feeling of going on holiday to somewhere distinctly different to home. It puts a spring in the step of the adventurer, bounding new horizons, fascinated by the secret treasure trove they have just found; that new discovery. ‘<i>Make way, I’m an explorer! I’ve seen things!’</i> The scene is different, the people are different, and the drink is different. So what stops us from venturing to a new bar or club each time we head out for the evening? After all, there’s so much choice out there!</p>
<p>It’s simple: Time.</p>
<p>If our goal is to go out somewhere for a drink, then we face two major influences on our time. The first is travel <strong>to</strong> a location; we will place a limit on how much time we are prepared to travel in order to reach our goal. So, let’s say we’re currently in Shoreditch, looking to head out to Soho. If you’re looking for that thrill in finding a new venue, which one in Soho do you choose? There are so many. This brings in the second factor of time; travelling further <strong>around</strong> a location. We do not have time to go on a wild-goose chase, looking in the window of each potential place. We cannot afford the time in our busy lives to take a stroll around until we settle upon a place. No doubt before we find it the bar will be packed with no seats! So, we want to make best use of our time. We want to know what a place is like before we get there. You’re making your decision now and need the right info to help you decide, so when you arrive in Soho, you know exactly where you intend to go.</p>
<p>Well, the solution to our problem is coming and it&#8217;s called Shnergle. As more and more of us have smartphones and we increasingly make decisions on the move, a ‘reconnaissance’ app that allows us to ‘see’ other places right now would be very valuable. Time-stamped images, time-sensitive deals, intentions of others, and a social comments feed, are all beneficial ingredients to solving the problem of not wasting our time; helping us choose before we commit to going there. <strong>Here’s a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMwYbR1ywFM">video</a> to show you what I mean</strong>.</p>

As we hadn’t launched yet, we weren’t keen to ‘plug’ Shnergle. So, we took a different approach and talked about some insights of our journey so far we thought they’d find interesting. Here’s a little summary…</p>
<p>First point to make was – happy people succeed.</p>
<p>As Blaise Pascal once said, ‘all men seek happiness&#8230;’ To achieve this, people will pursue different resolves – spiritually, financially, socially etc. We spend a lot of our lives working and it is enormously important therefore to enjoy what you do. Happy people engage in their work more and outperform the unhappy. They are more cooperative, create stronger team relationships and make for more effective leaders. Having the big house and expensive car may evoke to some as measures of success. In reality, your ultimate measure of success is whether you are happy.</p>
<p><i>So, pursue the things you enjoy as you’re more likely to be a success at them.</p>
<p></i></p>
<p>Second, if a startup is for you, then be prepared to step out of your comfort zone.</p>
<p>Tech startups are inherently filled with uncertainty and building it into a sustainable business is the challenge. There’s no guarantee the venture will be a success; the market might simply not be interested and it’s frequently difficult to reduce the risk by testing the concept in advance without letting the ‘cat out of the bag’. It is a fast paced world where risk and excitement are entwined so easily, and fear becomes a frequent visitor; it is all the worse when it is just yourself and no safety net to catch you.</p>
<p>In order to succeed, it is important to overcome this fear; it leads to paralysis and lack of action – the most certain path to failure. For this reason it is critical you ‘<i>don’t be your own worst enemy</i>’ and allow fear to create a self-fulfilling prophecy. Fear is however also a positive emotion; it tips you off to risks around you which you need to deal with. In order to succeed you need to become comfortable with fear – a travelling companion who tells you that you are still a balanced human, but that you are pushing yourself to achieve.</p>
<p>The military are experts in training people to manage fear; their preferred tool is Adventurous Training. SCUBA diving for example, to the beginner, may be unnatural or even insurmountable. Applying some determination and encouragement, this will be overcome and they will be diving wrecks at night within the week. The fear boundary has continuously been pushed with every new experience and as a result confidence becomes your defender.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there are many things in life to be afraid of. All the effort could come to no avail and if you were to ‘watch the things you gave your life to, broken, and stoop and build ‘em up with worn out tools’ (taken from Rudyard Kipling’s ‘If’ poem), you’ll be immensely admired for having the pluck to have given it a go in the first place.</p>
<p><i>Show me a man who never made a mistake, and I’ll show you a man who never tried anything.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the evening that hatched the idea behind Shnergle, Rob and I set to work on the practicalities of the concept.

No point having the best name and the worst concept.</p>
<p>A lot of time can, and arguably should, be spent on choosing the right brand name, as you’ll be stuck with it indefinitely. A name is after all your identity to differentiate you from your competitors and takes a while to build and will be costly to change. It is also the first encounter people have with your company; the smile at the front door. From first entry into the market, perceptions and associations will be drawn and attributed to the name.</p>
<p>What do you want from the name? For us it;</p>
<ul>
<li>needed to be easy to pronounce and sound good. The majority of smartphone apps were simple one or two-word names, usually no more than three syllables.</li>
<li>must be memorable so that it transfers more readily through word of mouth. Something fun to say, maybe even able to convert for use as either noun, adjective or verb.</li>
<li>must be unique so that it can be found quickly in searches. Not lend itself to confusion with a similar already established brand.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve all had those great resolutions when we’re lying in bed not even thinking about the issue concerning us, and then <i>wham</i>! It comes to you. For us, it happened after lunch on returning to our desks when Rob turned to me and simply said “how about Shnergle?” It instantly registered with me. I had used the word often in my past. It was a synonym for recce (or reconnaissance), that evoked stealth search in military circles; to find out information on an area of strategic interest. It was recognisable to me and would be to approximately 100,000 soldiers in the UK, but would it make sense to others? Could we make it recognisable to everyone else? Time will tell. Any other random, obscure name had no more chance of success and doubtful close association to our concept.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to fully agree straightaway as we hadn’t even began brainstorming for it yet. We didn’t want to get it wrong, but it did fit. We couldn’t see a reason not to use it so we went with it; it certainly beat Ajax!</p>
